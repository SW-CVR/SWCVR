**Welcome to SWCVR!**

------------------------
**Who are we?**
------------------------
A small team of displaced, passionate creators whom will not be giving up on our beloved timesink without a fight. Turned away from the official Community hub under false/exaggerated pretenses, we decided to be the change we seek; so here we are.

------------------------
**What is SWCVR?**
------------------------
Stormworks Community Vehicle Repository is an open source, free place to submit your personal creations in absence of, or addition to the SWCH.
Unlike the SWCH, We offer our verified creators personal sections within SWCVR, giving them a place they can 'call home', so to speak. Featuring creator profiles, Community Collaboration, among many other things that SWCH does not.

------------------------
**The Basic Ruleset, how to submit & how to apply**
------------------------
The rules are no different than many other places; Uploading of NSFW/L, Questionable, or Illegal materials will result in complete exclusion & any other action deemed necessary;
Do not use SWCVR to harass, threaten, defame, or or otherwise attack fellow creators within or outside of SWCVR;
Please keep swearing, or otherwise untasteful remarks to a minimum in all materials uploaded to SWCVR;
Absolutely no racism or sexism will be tolerated, discussion is one thing, outright attacks are not civil discourse & will be handled per acting moderator's discretion.

------------------------
**Submissions - Applications**
